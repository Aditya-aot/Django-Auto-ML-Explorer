"Here's a description of the data you provided:"
"The data consists of three objects representing car properties and one object containing correlation coefficients for those properties."
"Car Properties Objects:"
"- The first car has an engine size of 2.0, was produced in 2010, its average price is 46836 BRL, and it's 13 years old. Some properties like fuel type, gearbox, brand, model, fipe_code, authentication, month of reference, and year of reference are missing or undefined."
"- The second car has an engine size of 2.8, was produced in 2016, its average price is 106165 BRL, and it's 22 years old. Similar to the first car, some properties like fuel type, gearbox, brand, model, fipe_code, authentication, month of reference, and year of reference are missing or undefined."
"- The third car has an engine size of 6.7, was produced in 2023, its average price is 8600000 BRL, and it's 38 years old. Like the previous cars, some properties like fuel type, gearbox, brand, model, fipe_code, authentication, month of reference, and year of reference are missing or undefined."
"Correlation Matrix:"
"The correlation matrix shows the relationship between each property (year_of_reference, engine_size, year_model, avg_price_brl, age_years). For example, there is a strong positive correlation between engine size and average price (0.3455731428248873) and between year of reference and age years (1.0). The correlation between year model and age years is highly negative (-0.9999999999999956), meaning as the year of the car increases, its age decreases. Similarly, there's a strong negative correlation between avg_price_brl and age_years (-0.3042931794947078)."
